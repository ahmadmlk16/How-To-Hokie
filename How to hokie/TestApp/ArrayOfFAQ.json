In general, it is easiest to get a taxi or uber drive to campus from the airport or have a friend come pick you up. Additionally, because of the expensive travel cost to and from the airport, if you can’t get a bus, it is sometimes cheaper to fly into other VA airports, such as IAD or Richmond, and then bus from there."

If a student lives on campus and needs something in a pinch, like toothpaste, check out the small market located at Dietrick Hall."
