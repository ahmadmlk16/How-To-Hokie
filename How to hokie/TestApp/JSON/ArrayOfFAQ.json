        "question" : "Where is the closest Airport?"
        "answer" : "The closest airport to campus is the Roanoke Airport, with a 43 minute drive from campus and limited bus routes, getting to and from Roanoke and be quite expensive. In general, it is easiest to get a taxi or uber drive to campus from the airport or have a friend come pick you up. Additionally, because of the expensive travel cost to and from the airport, if you can’t get a bus, it is sometimes cheaper to fly into other VA airports, such as IAD or Richmond, and then bus from there."

        "answer" : "There are two major stores that sell common everyday goods, Kroger and Walmart. There are two Kroger’s in Blacksburg, one next to the Math Empo and one further down Main St. Walmart, however, is in Christiansburg; making much harder to access without a car but is definitely worth if you need items that are not food related. If a student lives on campus and needs something in a pinch, like toothpaste, check out the small market located at Dietrick Hall."
