        "description" : "This beautiful 3.8-mile trail is highly scenic and is easy to moderate to hike. It took me around 1 hour to hike to the waterfall and 1 hour back. The trail is well marked, and you can get to the falls without GPS help. The trail is not paved so expect to walk over mud and rocks along the way. Once you reach cascade falls you are in for a surprise, the waterfall is beautiful and has a nice shallow pool where the water collects and then runs of from. ",

        "description" : "This also very beautiful and scenic trail leads high up to a mountain top at around 3,000 feet. This is a moderate to hard trail due to its distance and climb. On the trail you gain around 1,500 feet. It took me 3 hours to hike up and 2 hours to hike back down. On the knob you can over look the valley and many other mountains for a truly beautiful sight. The trail therefore is heavily trafficked on the weekend. I went there in September of 2019. The fallen leaves had made the trail hard to distinguish with the forest floor. I even got lost while climbing up losing a good 30 minutes of time. I therefore recommend keeping a map handy or a charged cellphone.",
